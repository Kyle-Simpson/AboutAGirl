                    I unexpectedly run into an old flame at the airport.<br></br>
                    Am I going in the right direction?<br></br>
                    10 hours to go.<br></br>

                    Flight lands and I get to baggage claim.<br></br>
                    Why do I carry so much on my shoulders?<br></br>
                    8 hours to go.<br></br>

                    Now on the shuttle and we’re stuck in traffic.<br></br>
                    Stagnancy makes me feel like I’m missing out on something.  What should I be doing?<br></br>
                    6 hours to go.<br></br>

                    Made it onto the ferry and the stars look beautiful dancing in the sky.<br></br>
                    I want to join them, but would I fall?<br></br>
                    2 hours to go.<br></br>

                    As we wash ashore, the distance I have traveled strikes me.<br></br>
                    I reflect upon my journey and the countless people who helped me along the way.<br></br>
                    I would not have arrived without their guidance.<br></br>
                    I stop and recognize those who were not able to make the odyssey with me - it is for them I persevere.<br></br>
                    I step into the moonlight and take a deep breath.  I have arrived.  <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    I am here.
